# Challenge-1

## Module 1 Challenge for bootcamp

I took starter code provided by the bootcamp and edited the HTML file to be more HTML semantic in order for it to be more accessible.
This allows website to easier read the page for people with disabilities.

## Installation

I refactored the starter code by replacing the div elements with more readable elemenets such as header, main, and section. I also retitled the page and made images alt accessible.
